					The history of egg championships is thought to stretch as far back as 14,000 years ago, as illustrated in ancient cave paintings found at the <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lascaux" target="_blank">Lascaux Caves in France</a>. Historians believe that this may be one of the earliest depictions of ritual sacrifice. It is thought that each winner may have symbolically solidified the relationship of the people with the land that they depended on, giving hope that the community would thrive.

					If you look closely at one of the artworks, you can see that the figures have white and yellow faces, which we believe to be ritual yolk markings. This further solidifies the theory that prehistoric humans were naturally drawn to sympathetic magic in lieu of more sophisticated and scientific methods of bringing about desired change.

				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathetic_magic#:~:text=Sympathetic%20magic%2C%20also%20known%20as,based%20on%20imitation%20or%20correspondence" target="_blank">"Sympathetic magic is a type of magic based on imitation or correspondence."</a> An example of this can be seen in the use of a doll, meant to represent a specific person, which is then stuck with pins. By sticking pins in the eyes, for instance, the user may be hoping to blind their enemy, either figuratively or literally. We can then but wonder what significance yolked faces may have held in Palaeolithic times. The current but conflicting leading theories are that it may have been an attempt by the wearers to claim the power of the egg champion for themselves and their community, or that the painters themselves were attempting to inflict severe embarassement upon those depicted.

				An alternative, but less popular theory, postulates that by painting each community member’s face in the same manner, they may have been attempting to confuse detrimental spirits who were thought to wish to devour or otherwise destroy the current reigning egg champion. If this theory is correct, it would be very similar to the beginning of the tradition of having bridesmaids at weddings. A practice that still continues to this day, although the history of it has become inconsequential.

					Egg Champions are depicted in ancient art all over the world. In 1881, a relief depicting a winged figure carrying a large egg was discovered in the Tomb of Ramesses IX (r. 1129–1111 BCE) in the Valley of the Kings. It is speculated by some that egg champions were considered a status symbol for the wealthy and powerful in ancient Egypt. Although others claim that these images only show that some pharaohs were partial to hard boiled eggs. Perhaps the best proof of Egg Champion status may be seen in the surviving examples of mummified champions.

					During this article we have travelled from France to Egypt. This may of course be confusing, as England is considered to be the traditional home of the Egg Championship. If you have been concerned about this dear reader, please do not despair. There are of course many archaeological examples of early Egg Champion art in the United Kingdom. In fact, iron age egg champion pendants are so commonplace in the region, that finding one in an English or even Welsh garden is a common enough occurrence so as not to be of particular interest if shown off down the pub.

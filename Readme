Difficulties:

1) Egg Champion left logo wouldn't change size through pixel width in css. So I put the ID in the <img> rather than <a>. Not sure why that works

2 ) Couldn't turn nav bar with 

nav {
	background-color: #000000
}

so tried this which didn't work

header {
	background-color: #000000
}

Then tried 

#header {
	background: #000000
}

Added width etc and it worked

3) Left logo is overspilling header. Tried overflow: hidden, and z-index but didn't work.

#left-logo {
	height: auto;
	width: 250px;
	float: left;
	z-index: 1;
	overflow: hidden;
}

Tried also giving header z-index 2, didn't work.

Then thought maybe it's because of the relationship between the header and the image, so I set left-logo image height to 100% and that worked. But then the rest of the nav words are out of line, so changed line-height.

4) changing line height of nav bar words made them out of line depending on width of screen. Don't know why. So used -

#menu, #left-logo {
/* 	line-height: 70px; */
	vertical-align: middle;
}

This still didn't align it. Figured it might be because the left logo is too big. So made it smaller. But changing left logo height didn't help.

5) Right-egg logo. Couldn't turn the header into position: relative;, because that messed it up. So I figured I needed something else to make the position relative. But couldn't figure it out, so I went back to what I did a while ago, although I can't remember how I got there.

6) nav bar looks rubbish on mobile. Words aren't verticaly centered. Tried display: flex;, didn't work. Tried a few other things but didn't work so gave up for now. 

7) For first big egg in index, looked at https://www.bitdegree.org/learn/responsive-image#setting-background-size-to-fit-screen and love running. It didn't show up without setting both height and width (auto height made it disapear again). so crossing my fingers this will do for now.

8) Used animation for big eggs - took code from love running

9) Had to change header height to pixels rather than % so that I could top-margin the 1st big egg without any gaps. But this messed up the text, so changed line-height: 60px; in #menu

10) Need a big-egg-1-outer so that the bottom line doesn't move on zoom effect. Plus overflow: hidden; & position: relative;

11) when I added a second big egg, I couldn't figure out how to stop the zoom spilling into second egg. So turned off zoom.

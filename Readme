Difficulties:

1) Egg Champion left logo wouldn't change size through pixel width in css. So I put the ID in the <img> rather than <a>. Not sure why that works

2 ) Couldn't turn nav bar with 

nav {
	background-color: #000000
}

so tried this which didn't work

header {
	background-color: #000000
}

Then tried 

#header {
	background: #000000
}

Added width etc and it worked

3) Left logo is overspilling header. Tried overflow: hidden, and z-index but didn't work.

#left-logo {
	height: auto;
	width: 250px;
	float: left;
	z-index: 1;
	overflow: hidden;
}

Tried also giving header z-index 2, didn't work.

Then thought maybe it's because of the relationship between the header and the image, so I set left-logo image height to 100% and that worked. But then the rest of the nav words are out of line, so changed line-height.

4) changing line height of nav bar words made them out of line depending on width of screen. Don't know why. So used -

#menu, #left-logo {
/* 	line-height: 70px; */
	vertical-align: middle;
}

This still didn't align it. Figured it might be because the left logo is too big. So made it smaller.

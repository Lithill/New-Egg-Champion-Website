Difficulties:

1) Egg Champion left logo wouldn't change size through pixel width in css. So I put the ID in the <img> rather than <a>. Not sure why that works

2 ) Couldn't turn nav bar with 

nav {
	background-color: #000000
}

so tried this which didn't work

header {
	background-color: #000000
}

Then tried 

#header {
	background: #000000
}

Added width etc and it worked

3) Left logo is overspilling header. Tried overflow: hidden, and z-index but didn't work.

#left-logo {
	height: auto;
	width: 250px;
	float: left;
	z-index: 1;
	overflow: hidden;
}

Tried also giving header z-index 2, didn't work.

Then thought maybe it's because of the relationship between the header and the image, so I set left-logo image height to 100% and that worked. But then the rest of the nav words are out of line, so changed line-height.

4) changing line height of nav bar words made them out of line depending on width of screen. Don't know why. So used -

#menu, #left-logo {
/* 	line-height: 70px; */
	vertical-align: middle;
}

This still didn't align it. Figured it might be because the left logo is too big. So made it smaller. But changing left logo height didn't help.

5) Right-egg logo. Couldn't turn the header into position: relative;, because that messed it up. So I figured I needed something else to make the position relative. But couldn't figure it out, so I went back to what I did a while ago, although I can't remember how I got there.

6) nav bar looks rubbish on mobile. Words aren't verticaly centered. Tried display: flex;, didn't work. Tried a few other things but didn't work so gave up for now. 

7) For first big egg in index, looked at https://www.bitdegree.org/learn/responsive-image#setting-background-size-to-fit-screen and love running. It didn't show up without setting both height and width (auto height made it disapear again). so crossing my fingers this will do for now.

8) Used animation for big eggs - took code from love running

9) Had to change header height to pixels rather than % so that I could top-margin the 1st big egg without any gaps. But this messed up the text, so changed line-height: 60px; in #menu

10) Need a big-egg-1-outer so that the bottom line doesn't move on zoom effect. Plus overflow: hidden; & position: relative;

11) when I added a second big egg, I couldn't figure out how to stop the zoom spilling into second egg. So turned off zoom. 

12) Can't seem to center big egg text 3. Tried text-align, and margin-left & right auto. Didn't work. Used right: 38%; instead.

13) The index page needed a payoff so I made a video. Difficulty getting video to show. This website helped - https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/youtube-refused-to-connect/245262. Then had difficulties with sizing, and used this as I wanted it full screen - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24157940/iframe-height-auto-css. But it was too big and text got missed out when you played it. Nothing I tried worked out, so I made a div to fit the video to. Ended up doing this, but it isn't responsive:

 .container {
	 background-color: blue;
    width: 100vi;
    height: 655px;
 }

 .video {
	 height: 100%;
	 width: 100%;
 }

I wanted it to look less like a youtube video so used info here - https://freshysites.com/web-design-development/how-to-use-youtube-parameters-and-recent-changes/. And changed code to src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-kl4j_AEC5k?rel=0&amp;controls=0" class="video".

14) used love running footer as basic for my footer. Having trouble with white space under footer. I read this - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54836610/why-is-the-background-color-of-my-footer-not-filling-my-entire-footer and changed my background colour. But now when i put height to 60px, the border rides up. Degbugged in chrome, it looks like it is something to do with the class "social-networks" it is overspilling the footer, but when i add this to the class - height: 60px;, doesn't change anything. Then debugged and figured out it was the margin on the social network class.

15) Wanted the page you are on to be yellow. But the 'active' class was being overidden by "menu a" text colour. Making it an id didn't work. So I took the text color out of "menu a" and created a "not-active" class where the text is white, and applied that to all other header links.
